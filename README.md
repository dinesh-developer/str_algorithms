# Substring Searching Algorithms 

We saw questions in interviews like check pattern P is a substring of another string T.

Here we'll learn about few String Matching Algorithms like below:

1. Brute Force Method
2. Rabin-karp string Matching Algorithm
3. KMP Algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
4. Boyer-Moore algorithm

Note:  
- Boyer-Moore algorithm is very fast on the large alphabet, for small it's not preferable.
- For binary strings, KMP is recommended.
- For short patterns, the brute force is better.
